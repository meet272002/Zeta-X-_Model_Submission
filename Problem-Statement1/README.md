# Problem Statement 1 - Accident Severity Classification

This directory contains the **final implementation** for **Problem Statement 1**, focused on predicting **accident severity** using the UK Road Accident & Safety Data (2024).

## Objective
To develop a robust Machine Learning model that classifies accidents into:
- **Slight**
- **Serious**
- **Fatal**

based on environmental factors, road characteristics, vehicle information, and driver attributes.

## About This File
The notebook in this directory represents the **final, production-ready version** of the accident severity classification model.  
It includes:

- Complete preprocessing pipeline  
- Handling of class imbalance (SMOTE)  
- Feature encoding and transformation  
- Model selection and hyperparameter tuning  
- Final evaluation with metrics such as F1-score, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix  
- Exporting of the trained model for deployment or further analysis  

## Models Used
During experimentation, multiple models were tested.  
The final notebook here contains the **best-performing approach** based on accuracy, recall, and balanced evaluation.

## Note
Earlier experimental models (including Bagging, LightGBM, and baseline versions) are available in the `Model/` directory.  
**This file represents the finalized solution for Accident Severity Classification.**
