# Problem Statement 2 — Infrastructure Safety Optimization

This directory contains the **final implementation** for **Problem Statement 2**, focused on identifying and analyzing road infrastructure factors that contribute to accident severity in the UK Road Accident & Safety Data (2024).

## Objective
To examine road, environmental, and junction-related features in order to:
- Identify high-risk road segments  
- Determine which infrastructure elements most influence accident severity  
- Provide data-driven insights for improving road design and safety planning  

## About This File
The notebooks in this directory represent the **final analytical workflow** for Problem Statement 2.  
They include:

- Infrastructure-specific feature analysis  
- Comparative severity distribution across road types, junctions, lighting, and speed zones  
- Model-based importance ranking for infrastructure-related variables  
- Interpretability insights to help urban planners prioritize safety improvements  
- Final documented conclusions summarizing key findings  

## Methods Used
This module includes:
- Statistical analysis  
- Feature importance scoring  
- Visualization-driven insights  
- ML-based pattern discovery (where applicable)  

## Note
Earlier experimental notebooks related to infrastructure analysis may exist in other directories.  
**This folder contains the finalized analysis and conclusions for Infrastructure Safety Optimization.**
