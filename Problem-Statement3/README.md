# Problem Statement 3 - Collision Risk Prediction

This directory contains the **final implementation** for **Problem Statement 3**, focused on building an explainable collision risk prediction model using the UK Road Accident & Safety Data (2024).

## Objective
To develop a predictive model that estimates the **likelihood of a collision** occurring under various road, environmental, vehicle, and driver conditions.  
The goal is to enable:

- Proactive safety interventions  
- Early identification of high-risk scenarios  
- Data-driven decision support for road safety authorities  

## About This File
The notebook in this directory represents the **final and refined version** of the collision risk prediction model. It includes:

- Data preprocessing and feature selection  
- Class imbalance handling (SMOTE/undersampling)  
- Model development using advanced ML algorithms  
- Evaluation using metrics such as Precision-Recall AUC, ROC-AUC, and F1-Score  
- Explainability analysis (feature importance, SHAP interpretations)  
- Final risk prediction output formulation  

## Approach Highlights
The solution focuses on:

- Understanding environmental and driver-related factors that increase risk  
- Modeling high-risk vs low-risk scenarios  
- Interpreting model predictions for transparency and decision support  

## Note
This directory contains the **final consolidated work** for Problem Statement 3.  
Any preliminary or experimental notebooks are available in the `Model/` directory.  
**This folder is the official and final reference for the Collision Risk Prediction solution.**
